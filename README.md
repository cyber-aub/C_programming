# Mastering C & Data Structures

I'm an aspiring programmer who has completed the C & Data Structures course by Neso Academy. 
This repository showcases my solutions to various programming exercises and projects from the course.

During this learning journey, I tackled problems like sorting algorithms, dynamic memory allocation, and graph traversal.
Implementing these data structures in C helped me deepen my understanding of their efficiency and applications.

This repository is valuable for anyone who has taken the Neso Academy C & Data Structures course or is learning C and data structures independently.
It can serve as a reference for understanding concepts, applying them in practice, and improving problem-solving skills.

Feel free to use and learn from my code. I welcome feedback and contributions to enhance this repository! If you're interested in learning C and data structures, I highly recommend the Neso Academy course.
